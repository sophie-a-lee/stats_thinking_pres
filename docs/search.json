In this course, we will not focus on analysis methods. Instead, we will be focusing on thinking statistically.\nStatistical thinking involves describing data and complex systems in relatively simple terms whilst acknowledging uncertainty that exists. The process of statistical thinking involves critically appraising available data, identifying patterns using visualisations and summaries, and communicating results in a clear, concise manner. Statistical thinking could be thought of as data-driven critical thinking."

We ask GPs around the UK to suggest patients from their surgery that are currently being treated for anxiety and depression to take part in the study.

First, visualisations allow us to explore the data, identify potential outliers and errors, or check that the variables behave in the way we would expect them to if they have been recorded correctly. Visualisations can also be used as an analysis tool, allowing us to identify trends in the data or differences between groups. Finally, visualisations can help to convey messages to an audience in a clear, concise way that is often more powerful than presenting them using numbers or text.
