## What is statistical thinking?
Statistical thinking involves describing data and complex systems in relatively simple terms whilst acknowledging uncertainty that exists. The process of statistical thinking involves critically appraising available data, identifying patterns using visualisations and summaries, and communicating results in a clear, concise manner. Statistical thinking could be thought of as **data-driven critical thinking**. Statistical thinking does NOT require complicated analysis methods. Often, the simplest approaches can be the most effective.

## Why statistical thinking?
Statistical thinking is a necessary skill, not just in work but in personal lives too. We are constantly bombarded by data via the news and social media. Often the claims are exaggerated or skewed to fit a certain narrative. The human brain is not very good at interpreting risk and has a tendency to catastrophise. Thinking statistically allows us to sift through claims and make our own minds up based on evidence.
